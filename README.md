patchwork-next
===

Very early **work-in-progress** attempt at remaking [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) using [patchbay](https://github.com/dominictarr/patchbay) and UX/ideas from [ferment](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment).

The goal is to make a standalone, easy to install, "social" view into the ssb world.

## Install and run

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mmckegg/patchwork-next
$ cd patchwork-next
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## TODO

- [ ] Preserve scroll on back button
- [ ] Main navigation buttons
- [ ] Easy navigation sidebar
- [ ] Contacts sidebar
- [ ] Lots of styling
- [ ] Compressed feed (the algorithm :wink:)
  - [ ] Thread previews in feed [figure out how to do this streaming]
- [ ] Add more todos!
