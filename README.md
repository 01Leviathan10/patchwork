patchwork-next
===

Very early **work-in-progress** attempt at remaking [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) using [patchbay](https://github.com/dominictarr/patchbay) and UX/ideas from [ferment](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment).

The goal is to make a standalone, easy to install, "social" view into the ssb world.

## Install and run

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mmckegg/patchwork-next
$ cd patchwork-next
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## TODO

- [x] Main navigation buttons
- [x] Compressed feed (the algorithm :wink:)
- [ ] Endless scrolling (or load more) on main feed
- [ ] Power user tabs (right-click, Open in New Tab -> tab interface appears safari style)
- [ ] Preserve scroll on back button
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Easy navigation sidebar
- [ ] Contacts sidebar
- [ ] Show digs on posts in a nicer way (make it clear that you've dug something)
- [ ] Add more todos!
